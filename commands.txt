- Automatic fetching of today’s wind/wave forecast
- A database instead of CSV - done
- A dashboard showing visibility trends - done
- A map of dive sites - done
- A mobile-friendly UI
- A “log new dive” form inside the app


You can also convert:
- Visibility meters → feet
- Wind direction degrees → cardinal (N, NE, E, etc.)
- Wave period → swell energy index
- Add tide height from a tide API
Just tell me what you want to enhance next.


- Add logging so you can see which dives had missing data
- Add a “data completeness” dashboard
- Add a retry mechanism that fetches the nearest available day
- Switch to a different API for wind (e.g., NOAA, StormGlass)
- Add tide height, swell direction, or moon phase
Just tell me what direction you want to take next.



Here are some natural next upgrades:
• 	Add a site filter dropdown
• 	Add a 7‑day moving average
• 	Add tide height from a tide API
• 	Add swell direction
• 	Add a heatmap of visibility by month
• 	Add a forecast page that predicts visibility for the next 7 days
Just tell me which direction you want to go and I’ll build it with you.


If you want, we can now:
- Add site filters
- Add a moving average
- Add tide height to the dashboard
- Add a forecast visibility chart
- Make the dashboard mobile‑friendly
Just tell me what direction you want to take next.


Now that the map is working, you can enhance it with:
✔ Marker colors based on visibility - done
- Green = great
- Yellow = okay
- Red = poor

✔ Heatmap of visibility
Shows where conditions are consistently best.
✔ Cluster markers
If you log many dives at the same site.
✔ Tide + swell arrows
Overlay real‑time marine conditions.
✔ Click‑to‑add new dive
Let you drop a pin and log a dive directly from the map.


Click‑to‑add‑dive
(drop a pin → log a new dive)


Edit dive location by dragging the marker
✔ Edit dive date/time
✔ Re-fetch conditions when date/time changes
✔ Add photo uploads for each dive
✔ Add a full dive-history table with filters
✔ Add a “best dive time today” predictor
